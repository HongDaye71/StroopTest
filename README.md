## Stroop Effect<br/>
In psychology, the Stroop effect is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli.<br/>
When asked to name the color of the word it takes longer and is more prone to errors when the color of the ink does not match the name of the color.<br/>

Congruent Stimuli : Match between the name of a color (e.g., The word "red" printed in red ink instead of red ink)<br/>
Incongruent Stimuli : Mismatch between the name of a color (e.g., The word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink) <br/>
