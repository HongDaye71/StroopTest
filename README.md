## Stroop Test <br/>
In the Stroop task, people simply look at color words, such as blue, red, or green. And they say what color text they saw<br/>
*The color word appears on the screen in two conditions (Congruent / Incongruent)<br/>

## Stroop Effect<br/>
In psychology, the Stroop effect is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli.<br/>
When asked to name the color of the word it takes longer and is more prone to errors when the color of the ink does not match the name of the color.<br/>

Congruent Stimuli : Match between the name of a color (e.g., The word "red" printed in red ink instead of red ink)<br/>
Incongruent Stimuli : Mismatch between the name of a color (e.g., The word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink) <br/>

## Requirements<br/>
- Unity3D (2019.3.14 recommended)<br/>
- Visual Studio Code (2021 recommended)<br/>

___

## Building<br/>
STROOP can be easily built from the source code by opening up the solution file in Visual Studio and performing a build.<br/>
* Number of word and Stiumlation condition(Congruent, Incongruent) can be set through Excel file setting in the Resource folder<br/>
